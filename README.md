# DDPG_LibTorch
An implementation of the DDPG Algorithm in LibTorch

As environment I used OpenAi-Gym
[C++ OpenAi-Gym API](https://github.com/openai/gym-http-api)

and 

[JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

I'm still trying to figure out why the network is not learning any policy
